    <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <p>It must contain a paragraph (150 words or more) explaining the problems that responsive web design solves, in your own words</p>
    <p>Reponsive web design solves a big problems such as
      slow performance, layouts that only work on limited devices,
      and content that is only accessible to some.

      Users hate waiting.  When they have to wait more than two seconds for a page to load they are very willing to 
      abandon your site and find another more responsive site.  In additional to the initial page load, users can
      run into interaction delays as they navigate or submit requests.  A responsive web design insures
      a page loads quickly and responds to user requests quickly.

      Secondly, responsive web design solves the problem with programming customizations for an ever growing list of screen sizes and resolutions
      for phones, tablets, desktops, and big screen TVs.  Code is no longer fragmented between mobile and desktop libraries.
      Pages are no longer microscopic on ultra high definition screens because relative sizing in CSS.
      Similarly when a page is viewed on very small screens
      content to longer off screen and only viewable by using horizontal scroll bars.  Content now adapts the the given screen.
      In additional to various screen sizes, devices can be viewed in different orientations.  A responsive web design
      considers for and adjusts content to the device orientation.


      Thirdly, when javascipt is turned off or a user is on a older browser or using a screen reader,
      websites still work and provide meaningful content to all users including accessibility challenged users.




      fallback so site still works if javascript is turned off or old browser is used. </p>
