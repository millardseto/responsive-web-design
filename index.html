  <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>

  <p>Reponsive web design solves a big problems such as slow performance,
    layouts that only work on limited devices, and content that is only
    accessible to some and appear inconsistently between different browsers.</p>

  <p>Users hate waiting. When they have to wait more than two seconds for a page
    to load they are very willing to abandon your site and find another more
    responsive site. In additional to the initial page load, users can run into
    interaction delays as they navigate or submit requests. A responsive web
    design insures a page loads quickly and responds to user requests quickly.</p>

  <p>Secondly, responsive web design solves the problem with programming
    customizations for an ever growing list of screen sizes and resolutions for
    phones, tablets, desktops, and big screen TVs. Code is no longer fragmented
    between mobile and desktop libraries.  Pages are no longer microscopic on
    ultra high definition screens because relative sizing in CSS. Similarly when
    a page is viewed on very small screens content to longer off screen and only
    viewable by using horizontal scroll bars. Content now adapts the the given
    screen and can take advantage of touch capabilities. In addition to various
    screen sizes, devices can be viewed in different orientations. A responsive
    web design considers for and adjusts content to the device orientation.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, responsive web design bring accessibility when technology is
    lacking or when users have physical challenges. When javascipt is turned off
    or a user is on a older browser or using a screen reader, or when a font is
    not available, a responsive web design still works and provide meaningful
    content to all users including accessibility challenged users who may be
    color blind or completely blind.
  </p>

  <p>Finally, a responsive web design gives (as much as possible) a consistent 
    user experience without using customized code.
